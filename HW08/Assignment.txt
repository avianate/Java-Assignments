Assignment description Inthis assignmentyouwillhavetocreate classes, useinheritance and usepolymorphism. Computing the capacitance of a circuit (32 points) Circuit classes (15 points): Create the following classes, similar to the ones for computing the resistance explained during lecture, to compute the total capacitance of a circuit with multiple capacitors: ¥ CapacitorCircuit (2points), ¥ SeriesCCircuit as a subclass of CapacitorCircuit (3points), ¥ ParallelCCircuit as a subclass of CapacitorCircuit (3points), ¥ Capacitor (2points). The CapacitorCircuit mustbeanabstract classwith thefollowing methods: ¥ getCapacitorCount() which returns the total number of capacitors in the circuit(3points), and ¥ getCapacitance() which returnsthetotal capacitance of thecircuit(2points).1 Unit tests (15 points): Create classes: ¥ CapacitorCircuitTest (4points), ¥ SeriesCCircuitTest (4points), ¥ ParallelCCircuitTest (4points), ¥ CapacitorTest (3points) totest each one ofyour classes. You shouldtest allthepublic methods ofyour classes(remembertotest circuitsthathave acombination of series andparallel sub-parts). Packages (2 points): ¥ Putyour classesinapackage named: cs5060.homework.hw08.circuit. ¥ Putyourtest classesinapackage named: cs5060.homework.hw08.circuit.test. 1Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits forformulas. 1 
Piggy bank (42 points) Piggy bank classes (19 points): Create a Coin classwith thefollowing methods(2points): ¥ 	constructor with avalueparameter(1point), ¥ getValue() method which returnsthevalueof thecoin(1point). Create a PiggyBank classwith thefollowing methods(17points): ¥ 	constructor with capacity(maximumnumberof coinsthepiggy bank canhold)parameter(1point), ¥ 	isEmpty() method(1point), ¥ 	isFull() method(2point), ¥ 	getCapacity() method(1point), ¥ 	addCoin(Coin) method(3points), ¥ 	getNumberOfCoins() method(2points), ¥ 	getTotalValue() method(3points), ¥ 	isBroken() method(1point), ¥ 	breakBank() method(3point). Notes (4 points): ¥ 	isEmpty should return true when thepiggy bank is broken. ¥ 	isFull should return false when thepiggy bank is broken. ¥ 	addCoin should throw FullPiggyBankException (2points)whenthepiggy bankisfull. ¥ 	addCoin should throw BrokenPiggyBankException (2 points) when the piggy bank is bro¥ken. ¥ 	getNumberOfCoins and getTotalValue should return 0 when thepiggy bank is broken. ¥ 	breakBank should return a list of all the coins, and throw a BrokenPiggyBankException if thepiggy bank is already broken. ¥ 	MakeFullPiggyBankException and BrokenPiggyBankException subclasses of Exception. Unit tests (17 points): Create a PiggyBankTest classtotestthe methods ofyour PiggyBank class. Create a test method for each method you have to test. The tests for each method of the PiggyBank class are worth the same as the method. Packages (2 points): ¥ 	Putyour classesinapackage named: cs5060.homework.hw08.piggybank. ¥ 	Putyourtest classesinapackage named: cs5060.homework.hw08.piggybank.test. 2
